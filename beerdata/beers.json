He brewed his interpretation using Valencia orange peel versus the traditional tart Curaçao orange peel, for a subtle sweetness. Then he added oats and wheat to create a smooth, creamy finish that’s inviting to the palate. As a final touch, he garnished the beer with an orange slice to heighten the citrus aroma and taste. Its natural unfiltered appearance adds to the depth of flavors in Belgian White*.\r\n \r\nAvailable in 12-oz. bottles, 6-pack, 12-pack, Brewmaster’s can, 16-oz. can, Draft",

Roast malt tones may sometimes contribute to the flavor and aroma profile. Low to medium-low levels of fruity-ester flavors are appropriate. Diacetyl should be very low, if evident. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

    "description": "Our flagship beer, Black Butte Porter defined Deschutes as a place intent to follow its own brewing muse. At a time when dark beer was viewed with suspicion, this deep, satiny brew went out and dispelled the myths for a generation of enthusiasts. Black Butte is rich in flavor yet easy to drink, with a creamy, smooth mouth feel. The slight hop bitterness up front only enhances the distinctive chocolate and roasted finish to come. It continues to reap accolades and medals from those who know best.",

Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley. The emphasis of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aromas define much of the character. Some slight acidity may be perceived but is not necessary. European hop aroma and flavor should be low or not perceived. Dry stouts have medium-light to medium body. Fruity esters are minimal and overshadowed by malt, high hop bitterness, and roasted barley character. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be very low or not perceived. Head retention and rich character should be part of its visual character.",
